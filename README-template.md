## My process
My process behind this was trying to make it as simple as it looks without overdoing the CSS and HTML
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned


This was a great way to practice basic HTML and CSS skills.


### Continued development


I'm curious to know how other developers approach flexbox in flexbox situations and if there are simpler ways
